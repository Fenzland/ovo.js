OvO.js
================================

This is just a little toy.

I'm trying to discover a new mode of web application project or framewark.
Maybe just for futrue.
Use ES6 module and don't care of old browsers (or explorers looks like broken browsers).
Reject bundlers and transpilers. Let modules separate and achieve demand loading.

* Routing.
* Treelike history control.
* Virtual DOM.
* Both template and render function can used to build page or component.
* Using standard Web Component.
* Extendable template language supporting.
* Promise base state.
